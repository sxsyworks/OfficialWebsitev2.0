    "The structural variation is generally more than 50bp, and the types include deletion, repetition, inversion, translocation and complex recombination, etc., with extremely diverse types and sizes. Previous studies have shown that structural variation is associated with a variety of human diseases, such as cancer, autism, and Alzheimer's disease. According to the most comprehensive meta-analysis of cancer genome to date conducted by the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) alliance, complex chromosome rearrangement is present in 17.8% of tumors and chromosome disruption is present in 22.3% of tumors. Accurate identification of structural variants is critical to further understanding the genome's characteristics and diagnosing or treating related diseases. Due to the limitation of short reads of traditional sequencing technology, there are a large number of false positives and false negatives in the analysis of structural variation, so the study of structural variation is still in the initial stage.
